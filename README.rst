This is a potentially very stupid idea to write a project management tool where all the tasks and and other junk are YAML files and uses a GitHub repo as the database to version control all changes.

I should be doing other work, but here I am in a Barnes and Noble drinking a (almost lukewarm) peppermint tea writing this README. Feel free to try this out or make a PR or something. But I'm intentionally going to commit right to master and may break things in this hobby project. So... use this at your own risk.

Right, back to your regularly scheduled README programming.
